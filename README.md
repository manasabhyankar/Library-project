# Library

## Create a functioning library without frameworks.

The goal of this project is to create a library without using any frameworks (like React, NodeJS, etc). This was created purely
in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses a stretched out library for a background to make things look nice (though in retrospect, it looks kinda bad).

The assignment is a part of [TheOdinProject's](https://theodinproject.com/) web development tutorials.

## TODO

1. Make the books' info line up better within the bookcase.
2. Make the bookcase larger, potentially rendering TODO #1 useless.
